Adjustable PSU

This is a simple adjustable power supply based on the LM317
adjustable voltage regulator. This PSU will accept an input
voltage of up to 40V and can output 1.2V to 37V @ 1.5Amps.

This circuit was designed to be used as a PSU for 
breadboarding & circuit bending where an adjustable voltage
PSU can be very useful. I have incorporated an Adafruit
3-wire voltage meter (https://www.adafruit.com/products/705)
in the design as a simple method of displaying the output 
voltage. There is a 2-pin Molex connector and a 2-pin header
for connection to the putput voltage, as well as a 2-pin 
header on the inpt voltage. I have designed a custom Molex
to barrel jack cable for circuitbending voltage-staving.
This circuit was designed to be powered with a center 
positive wall wart DC supply.
